#### Practical: upload a dataset to [Zenodo Sandbox](https://sandbox.zenodo.org/)

- Zenodo Sandbox is a mirror of the live Zenodo site
- When you upload a dataset to Zenodo sandbox the DOI associated with the upload is not registered with a global DOI authority

<!-- - Choose file to upload -->
<!-- - Select upload type: dataset -->
<!-- - Reserve DOI so that you can include it in linked research outputs such as published papers -->
<!-- - Add metadata including licensing and funding information -->
