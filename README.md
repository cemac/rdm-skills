# Introduction to Data Archiving

This content is to be used for MRes Climate and Atmospheric Science at University of Leeds.

## Overview
In this session we will outline principles and motivations for archiving research data and introduce some key concepts for creating reusable and long-lived research data. We will explore the concept of FAIR data, discuss how metadata can add value to research data, and provide practical guidance on data archiving including issues around standards compliance and licensing. We will examine a hierarchical data format commonly used in atmospheric science and work through an example of uploading a sample dataset to the commonly used data archive, Zenodo. We will review a sample data policy and discuss how to meet a journalâ€™s requirements for data availability.
By the end of the session, participants will be better able to:

1.	Discuss motivations for archiving research data
2.	Define FAIR data principles and discuss how these can be applied to enhance the re-usability of research data
3.	Understand the value of using metadata to describe research data
4.	Be aware of requirements to comply with data standards when archiving data
5.	Evaluate data archiving options and follow a procedure for uploading data to an archive
6.	Write a data availability statement to indicate how and where others can access the data underlying a paper
