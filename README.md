# Research Data Management skills training for postgraduate researchers.

This repository contains presentation slides and content that can be used for research data management skills training within the School of Earth and Environment. 

The slides are created using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) which pulls together markdown content from within the **`content`** folder. The slides themselves can be accessed via the github.io link in the 'About' section; please note that link will only inherit slide content from one branch at a time. Click on Settings > Pages, then under 'Build and deployment' select the branch you want the io page to inherit slides from.

Please be aware that this repository has been forked from the original reveal.js repository and modified to include slides and content relevant to research data management skills training.
